# AI Agent Handover: Continue Gemini CLI Sandbox Implementation

## Current Status
The Gemini CLI sandbox backend code has been successfully moved from this proof-of-concept repository to:
```
/Users/jannoszczyk/Documents/Github/GoFreddy-worktree-5/taskmaster-backend/gemini-cli/
```

## Your Task
Continue the implementation by following the comprehensive documentation that has already been prepared in this repository.

## Documentation to Follow

### 1. **PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md**
Read this first for the complete architectural vision:
- Kubernetes-based architecture with StatefulSets
- Container persistence strategy using custom images
- Database schema for state management
- Resource tier system
- Security architecture
- Monitoring and observability requirements

### 2. **AI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md**
This contains your detailed implementation instructions:
- Specific requirements for each component
- Code examples and patterns to follow
- Implementation phases (Core Migration → Persistence → Lifecycle → Monitoring)
- File structure for the main repository
- Testing requirements and success criteria

### 3. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**
Use this for the practical migration steps:
- Exact file mappings from this repo to main repo
- Required code modifications (package names, imports, Docker → Kubernetes)
- Integration points with existing platform
- Dependencies to add

## Key Implementation Focus

1. **Start with Phase 1** from the AI_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md:
   - Transform Docker client calls to Kubernetes API calls
   - Focus on getting basic pod creation working first

2. **The main transformation** is changing from Docker to Kubernetes:
   ```go
   // You'll be changing this pattern throughout the codebase:
   exec.CommandContext(ctx, "docker", ...) → clientset.CoreV1().Pods(...).Create(...)
   ```

3. **Integration points** with the existing monolithic backend:
   - Use existing authentication middleware
   - Share database connections
   - Add to existing gRPC server
   - Use existing monitoring infrastructure

## Files Already Moved
All necessary files have been moved to:
```
/Users/jannoszczyk/Documents/Github/GoFreddy-worktree-5/taskmaster-backend/gemini-cli/
```

You should analyze the directory structure to understand what files are available.

## Next Steps

1. **Read the three documentation files** in order (Architecture → Implementation → Migration)
2. **Set up Kubernetes client** in the main backend
3. **Start transforming sandbox_manager.go** as outlined in the guides
4. **Follow the phased approach** from the implementation prompt

## Important Notes

- The platform prefers **monolithic architecture** - integrate into the existing backend, don't create microservices
- **Package persistence** is critical - freelancers must be able to install npm/pip/apt packages that survive restarts
- **API keys must never be visible** to freelancers - use Kubernetes secrets
- **Complete usage tracking** is required for billing

All the detailed requirements, code examples, and architectural decisions are documented in the three guide files. This handover is simply to point you to those resources and confirm the current status.

Good luck with the implementation!
